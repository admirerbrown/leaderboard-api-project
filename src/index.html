        "Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than
        unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the
        world is full of educated derelicts. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the
        human race." â€”Calvin Coolidge
